-- We want to find out how many of each category of film GRACE MOSTEL has starred in.
-- So return a table with category_name and the count as the number_of_films that GRACE was in that category.
-- Your query should return a non-null value for every category even if GRACE has been in no films in that category.
-- Order by the category name in descending order.

-- Put query for Q2 here
